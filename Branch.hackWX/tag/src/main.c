/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. The sum of the values is the TX to RX antenna delay, experimentally determined by a calibration process. Here we use a hard coded typical value
 *    but, in a real application, each device should have its own antenna delay properly calibrated to get the best possible precision when performing
 *    range measurements.
 * 2. The messages here are similar to those used in the DecaRanging ARM application (shipped with EVK1000 kit). They comply with the IEEE
 *    802.15.4 standard MAC data frame encoding and they are following the ISO/IEC:24730-62:2013 standard. The messages used are:
 *     - a poll message sent by the initiator to trigger the ranging exchange.
 *     - a response message sent by the responder allowing the initiator to go on with the process
 *     - a final message sent by the initiator to complete the exchange and provide all information needed by the responder to compute the
 *       time-of-flight (distance) estimate.
 *    The first 10 bytes of those frame are common and are composed of the following fields:
 *     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8841 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit addressing).
 *     - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
 *     - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA).
 *     - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 3 below.
 *     - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 3 below.
 *     - byte 9: function code (specific values to indicate which message it is in the ranging process).
 *    The remaining bytes are specific to each message as follows:
 *    Poll message:
 *     - no more data
 *    Response message:
 *     - byte 10: activity code (0x02 to tell the initiator to go on with the ranging exchange).
 *     - byte 11/12: activity parameter, not used here for activity code 0x02.
 *    Final message:
 *     - byte 10 -> 13: poll message transmission timestamp.
 *     - byte 14 -> 17: response message reception timestamp.
 *     - byte 18 -> 21: final message transmission timestamp.
 *    All messages end with a 2-byte checksum automatically set by DW1000.
 * 3. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants in this example to keep it simple but for a real product every device should have a
 *    unique ID. Here, 16-bit addressing is used to keep the messages as short as possible but, in an actual application, this should be done only
 *    after an exchange of specific messages used to define those short addresses for each device participating to the ranging exchange.
 * 4. Delays between frames have been chosen here to ensure proper synchronisation of transmission and reception of the frames between the initiator
 *    and the responder and to ensure a correct accuracy of the computed distance. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM Source Code Guide for more
 *    details about the timings involved in the ranging process.
 * 5. This timeout is for complete reception of a frame, i.e. timeout duration must take into account the length of the expected frame. Here the value
 *    is arbitrary but chosen large enough to make sure that there is enough time to receive the complete response frame sent by the responder at the
 *    110k data rate used (around 3 ms).
 * 6. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW1000 OTP memory.
 * 7. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of the message as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW1000. This means that our variable could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()). It is also to be noted that, when using
 *    delayed send, the time set for transmission must be far enough in the future so that the DW1000 IC has the time to process and start the
 *    transmission of the frame at the wanted time. If the transmission command is issued too late compared to when the frame is supposed to be sent,
 *    this is indicated by an error code returned by dwt_starttx() API call. Here it is not tested, as the values of the delays between frames have
 *    been carefully defined to avoid this situation.
 * 8. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW1000 User Manual for more details on "interrupts". It is also to be noted that STATUS register is 5 bytes long but, as the event we
 *    use are all in the first bytes of the register, we can use the simple dwt_read32bitreg() API call to access it instead of reading the whole 5
 *    bytes.
 * 9. As we want to send final TX timestamp in the final message, we have to compute it in advance instead of relying on the reading of DW1000
 *    register. Timestamps and delayed transmission time are both expressed in device time units so we just have to add the desired response delay to
 *    response RX timestamp to get final transmission time. The delayed transmission time resolution is 512 device time units which means that the
 *    lower 9 bits of the obtained value must be zeroed. This also allows to encode the 40-bit value in a 32-bit words by shifting the all-zero lower
 *    8 bits.
 * 10. In this operation, the high order byte of each 40-bit timestamps is discarded. This is acceptable as those time-stamps are not separated by
 *     more than 2**32 device time units (which is around 67 ms) which means that the calculation of the round-trip delays (needed in the
 *     time-of-flight computation) can be handled by a 32-bit subtraction.
 * 11. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *     DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
